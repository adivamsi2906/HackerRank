Given a  2D Array, :

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
We define an hourglass in  to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in 's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g
There are  hourglasses in , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in , then print the maximum hourglass sum.

For example, given the 2D array:

-9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
 0 -9  0  4 3 2
-9 -9 -9  1 2 3
 0  0  8  6 6 0
 0  0  0 -2 0 0
 0  0  1  2 4 0
We calculate the following  hourglass values:

-63, -34, -9, 12, 
-10, 0, 28, 23, 
-27, -11, -2, 10, 
9, 17, 25, 18
Our highest hourglass value is  from the hourglass:

0 4 3
  1
8 6 6

Explanation

 contains the following hourglasses:

The hourglass with the maximum sum () is:

2 4 4
  2
1 2 4


Solution:

def hourglassSum():
    arr = []
    sumlist=[]
    for _ in range(6):
        arr.append(list(map(int, input().rstrip().split())))
    s=len(arr)
    for i in range(s-2):
        for j in range(s-2):
            a=b=c=0
            sum=0
            a=arr[i][j]+arr[i][j+1]+arr[i][j+2] #first row sum 3 numbers
            b=arr[i+1][j+1]  #second row element 1 middle element
            c=arr[i+2][j]+arr[i+2][j+1]+arr[i+2][j+2] #3 rd row sum 3 elements
            sum=sum+a+b+c
            sumlist.append(sum)  #storing sum individually  in a list
    a=max(sumlist) #maximum of  sum
    print(a)
hourglassSum()
