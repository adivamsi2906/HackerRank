Given an array A of positive integers. Push all the zero’s of the given array to the end of the array. while maitaining the order of non-zero elements.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases. In each test cases, first line is number of elements in array N and next line contains array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the array after shifting all 0's to the end.​

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 103
0 <= Ai <=103

Example:
Input:
2
5
3 5 0 0 4
4
0 0 0 4

Output:
3 5 4 0 0
4 0 0 0

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The non-zero elements are preserve their order while the 0 elements are moved to the right.
Testcase 1: 4 is the only non-zero element and it gets moved to the left.



SOLUTION:

T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    s=int(input())
    l=list(map(int,input().split()))
    count=0
    for j in range(s):
        if l[j]!=0:
            l[count]=l[j]
            count+=1
    while(count<s):
        l[count]=0
        count+=1
    for k in l:
        print(k,end=" ")
    print()
Input:
2
5
3 5 0 0 4
4
0 0 0 4

Output:
3 5 4 0 0
4 0 0 0
